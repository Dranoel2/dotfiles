# Dotfiles
# About
My dotfiles for Arch Linux with ZSH. They might work on other distros but I haven't tested them.

# Usage
To use them, just clone the repo to `~/.dotfiles` and run the install script:
```
git clone --recurse-submodules -j10 https://github.com/Dranoel2/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
~/.dotfiles/install.sh
```
